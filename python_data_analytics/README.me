# London Gift Shop (LGS) - Retail Data Analytics

## Introduction

London Gift Shop (LGS) is a UK-based online retailer specializing in giftware. Despite having operated for over a decade, the company has seen stagnation in revenue growth. To address this challenge, the LGS marketing team aims to leverage data analytics to gain better insights into customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies. However, due to limited IT resources, LGS has partnered with Jarvis Consulting for data engineering and analytics services.

The goal of this project is to analyze customer shopping behavior using transactional data from LGS. The insights derived from this analysis will help the marketing team implement targeted marketing campaigns, such as email promotions, event-based marketing, and personalized discount offers.

### Technologies Used:
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data exploration and analysis.
- **Python** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas** for data wrangling and transformation.
- **NumPy** for numerical computations.
- **SQL** for querying transactional data from the provided database.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization.

## Implementation

### Project Architecture
The project is structured as follows:
- **Data Ingestion**: Transactional data is provided in SQL format by the LGS IT team.
- **Data Processing & Analysis**: The data is cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using Python and Pandas.
- **Results & Insights**: The analysis results are presented in Jupyter Notebook to assist LGS in decision-making.

### Data Analytics and Wrangling
